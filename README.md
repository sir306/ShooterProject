NOTE this is a prototype and is more to show case what I can do on Unreal Engine and knowledge I have gained from doing this.

# Description
Here I have created a prototype of a third person shooter game, featuring enemy AI that will attack you if you agro them by shooting or getting to close to them. It also features some really cool techniques that I have learned from the Udemy course i used to build this, such as Line Tracing, Post Process materials, data tables, behaviour tress, animation, montages and many more features that I have learned.
